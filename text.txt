idea:
read -> buff
buff -> linked lists of size buff until a new line character is found in a buff
check if buff has information if so then copy into line first if there is a newline character with data afterwards then set the 
old static equal to the rest of the current static and return the correct code

copy out of lists to line until a new line character
save the rest of the link after the first new line character to a static variable
return correct code
